How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Rewriting user needs into user stories helps break down what the user is expecting to do/see when using the program. User stories can be written with pseudocode to help developers get a rough idea to develop their program.

#
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Small incremental changes to code with frequent testing on top of open communication with teammates/colleagues regarding projects. Also trying to plan out before a project using user stories.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I think being a good team member means to be able to openly and clearly communicate with other teammates and to effectively contribute towards a 
project. This could be in the form of directly producing work via a product backlog, code, or planning and facilitating team events.
